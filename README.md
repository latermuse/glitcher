glitcher
========

Glitcher makes beautiful glitch art out of multimedia files.

Description:
    This program takes an input filename and an output filename passed as
    arguments, then uses additive and subtractive glitching to
    create a new image and output to the output filename.

example usage:
    ./glitch "/home/ron/funny.jpg" "/home/ron/funny-glitched.jpg"
    ./glitch "/home/music/siesta.mp3" "/home/music/siesta-glitched.mp3"


Here are some examples of what output could look like:

![Example 2](https://raw.github.com/latermuse/glitcher/master/examples/example2.jpg)

![Example 3](https://raw.github.com/latermuse/glitcher/master/examples/example3.jpg)

![Example 4](https://raw.github.com/latermuse/glitcher/master/examples/sexy.jpg)


Beware, this program purposely corrupts and glitches files to make art. It could destroy some of your precious files by accident. Be very careful when using it.
